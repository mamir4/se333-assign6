Reflection:
The manual part of the tests (BookStoreTest in the playwrightTradtional package) was an incredibly easy and fun to use tool. I think what made it so easy was that you could make assertions while you were testing the UI, instead of manually typing it out.

The most challenging part of the assignment was definitely the LLM prompting, since no matter how descriptive or direct your prompt was, the LLM was unable to carry out the tests successfully. I think you have to keep on starting new chats, because at a certain point it just kept running around in circles trying to make the tests work. I have also realized that it generates a lot of useless files with summaries and other texts that break down what it did, so I specifically asked it not to do that.

The tests kept on failing until I went to my own code and showed it how I did it, and then it edited its own code with that as inspiration, and it finally worked. It also made and changed an incredible amount of files that I had to commit so that was confusing.

Overall, I enjoyed using playwright, but I don't really see how using AI to generate the tests completely was beneficial. I think it can help in editing or refining tests, but definitely not generating them on its own since it would take more time to debug its generated material than to write it from scratch myself.
